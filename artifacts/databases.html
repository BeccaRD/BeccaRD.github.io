      <h2>Narrative</h2>
      <p>
        As I have for the previous enhancements, I selected my Android Inventory Management application from CS 360 for this enhancement as well. This application allows users to view, add, delete, and update inventory records in a local SQLite database. The reason I continued to enhance this application is because it provides a clear opportunity to demonstrate improvements in data management and database design over time.
	The reason I included this application in my ePortfolio is because it highlights practical database skills that are essential in software development. My focus was improving data reliability rather than adding on new features for this enhancement. First, I strengthened the inventory tables. I did this by adding database constraints including NOT NULL, CHECK, and UNIQUE in order to prevent invalid or duplicate data from being stored. In addition, I made improvements to the query that is used to retrieve inventory items by ordering results with consistency. With these improvements I have demonstrated my understanding of how database design decisions could directly affect application stability and data quality.
	The enhancement I made here met the course outcomes I planned to address back in module one related to using well-founded tools and techniques in computing practices. I showed my progress towards developing a more security-conscious and reliable approach to software design by enforcing data rules at the database level. As this enhancement aligns with my original goals for the database category, I do not need to make changes to my original plan.
	As I reflect on the enhancement progress, I learned how important defensive database design is instead of relying only on user input validation. One of the challenges I faced was making sure that the application handled database errors smoothly when constraints were triggered. I would say that overall, this experience has strengthened my understanding of how databases support application integrity and reinforced the value of testing database behaviors.
