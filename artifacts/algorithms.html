      <h2>Narrative</h2>
      <p>
        As with my last enhancement, I am continuing to use the Android Inventory app I had originally developed in CS – 360: Mobile Architecture and Programming. This application allows the user to do a variety of things such as add, delete, update, or view inventory items that are stored in a database. The reason I chose to continue on with this artifact is because of the strong foundation it has for demonstrating growth. 
	This will be included in my ePortfolio because this clearly and effectively demonstrates my ability to apply, in a practical way, algorithms and data structures. Within this enhancement, I really focused on how the inventory data is displayed and processed within the application. The first thing I added was a search feature that uses linear search algorithm to filter items. It can be filtered by name, and this demonstrates loops, maps, conditional logic, and the use of lists. In addition, another thing I improved was data handling. I achieved this by separating the full data set from the displayed list. This helped prevent issues when searching or refreshing the inventory list. In turn, these improvements helped the usability of the application as well as the underlying code. 
	These enhancements meet the course outcomes I planned to address in module one of this course relating to evaluating and designing computing solutions. Here I demonstrated progress in applying algorithmic logic while keeping the solution as simple and effective as possible while also selecting appropriate data structures. Because this enhancement aligns with my initial goals for the algorithms and data structures enhancement, I do not need to update my original plan. 
	As I reflect on the enhancement process, one lesson that stuck out to me was the importance of managing the data flow within the application. This is especially true when multiple features interact. My biggest challenge here was getting the inventory list to correctly reset itself after filtering but, overcoming this challenge gave me a better understanding of how algorithms and user interface components work together. Overall, this experience helped me gain more confidence in myself and my skillset.
