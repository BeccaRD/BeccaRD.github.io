      <h2>Narrative</h2>
      <p>
        The artifact of choice for this enhancement is the Android Inventory App that I developed for CS-360: Mobile Architecture and Programming. This is one of the projects I have the most pride in throughout my journey as a computer science student. This app includes a log in screen and an inventory management screen that allows the user to add, delete, or update inventory. This app was created to practice developing a simple mobile app that incorporates database interaction, user input, and layout design. The reason I chose this project, besides being proud of it, was it being a good foundation or showcasing my skills and demonstrating improvement in software design and engineering practices. 
	While this is a simple project, it is a realistic app scenario and is a good foundation to show how even the simplest of apps can be improved with better software design principles. My focus in this enhancement was not necessarily adding new features but to improve the structure and organization of my code. The first step was refactoring main activity to separate things, such as, event handling, UI set up, and logic into clearer methods. In addition, to prevent crashes caused by invalid user input, I added safer input validation and centralized user feedback into a helper method. 
	When it comes to software design and engineering, the enhancement met the course outcomes as outlined in Module One. This demonstrated my progress toward using well-founded tools and techniques, which is demonstrated by adding defensive programming practices and improving separation of concerns. This enhancement lines up well with what was proposed for this category so no need for change to my plan. 
	As I reflect on my first enhancement process, the importance of structuring code so that it is easier to understand and update is a lesson that has stuck with me. Deciding how much to refactor without getting too complicated is a challenge I faced. Overall, this process helped me understand the tradeoffs between keeping code simple and scalability but that has only made me more confident in my ability to improve projects moving forward.
