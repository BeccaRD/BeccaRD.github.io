          <p>
            Welcome to my ePortfolio! Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Rebecca La Rocca. Currently residing in South Carolina with my husband and 2 kids, some of my favorite pasttimes is getting outdoors and indulging into some of my favorite video games. The latter is what really jumpstarted my love for technology and inspired my career goal of working with computers and more specifically, the field of cyber security.

      <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
      <p>
        Throughout my time in the Computer Science program here at SNHU I moved from just focusing on simply making programs run to thinking more in depth about how systems are structured, maintained, and used. Revisiting one of my earlier projects during the capstone showed me how better organization, validation, and database design improves reliability as well as usability. This helped clarify my goals of working in a software development environment where I can build practical, dependable applications.
The program has also strengthened my communication skills. Through documentation, discussions, and project explanations, I have had lots of practice translating technical ideas for different audiences, especially those audiences that are non-technical. I learned that developers must understand requirements as well as clearly explain the solutions, not just simply write code and nothing else. Collaboration and communication have become an important part of my development process alongside programming.
My coursework improved my understanding of data structures and algorithms by teaching me when to apply them instead of only how to implement them. Knowing the why helps guide my implementation. I also gained experience with software engineering and databases by separating responsibilities in code, validating input, as well as enforcing rules at the database level. Considering validation and data handling introduced a stronger awareness of security and reliability in application design.
The artifacts in my portfolio demonstrate this growth. The software design enhancement shows improved structure and maintainability, the algorithms enhancement demonstrates logical problem solving and data handling, and the database enhancement highlights data integrity and stability. Together they represent my transition from writing working code to designing complete solutions and preparing for a professional development environment. I am beyond grateful for what I have learned here at SNHU.
